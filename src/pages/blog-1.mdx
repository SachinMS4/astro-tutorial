## 1. Limit number of lines displayed.

If you come across a situation where you have to limit the number of text lines displayed, then you can achive that with the below code.
it also adds text elipsis at the end. Trick is to use old display properties. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-line-clamp)

```
  display: -webkit-box;         // it's an old flex box style
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical; // similar to flex-direction: column;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3         // specify number of line as limit
  overflow: hidden;             // hide lines after line #3
```

Gotcha: This code is no longer recommended. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-orient) docs say's it is being deprecated.

## 2. Flatten array of arrays to one-dimensional array.

Let's say you have an array like `[1,[2,3],[4,5],6]` and would like to transform it into `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. For this you can use JavaScript's `flatMap()` Array method.

### How flatMap() works?

Similar to other Array methods like map() and filter(), it uses callback function to iterate over each item in the array and outputs a flattened array. Same can be also achived by applying map() and flat() methods subsequently. But flatMap() is more effecient as it does this in one iteration.

Gotcha: It only flattens the input array by one level.
